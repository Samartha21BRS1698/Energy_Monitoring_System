# 🔋 Cloud-Based Home Energy Monitoring System (Simulated)

> A cloud based Energy monitoring system which gives real-time information about the appliances’ energy
consumption, enabling users to make informed decisions for energy conservation

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Simulates voltage, current, and power per appliance
- 📊 Real-time line chart + bar graph for power usage
- 🕹️ Virtual appliance ON/OFF toggles
- 💾 Export data to CSV
- 🚨 High-usage alerts (e.g., power > 400W)
- 🌐 One-click cloud deployment with Streamlit

---

 The project consists fully software-based smart energy dashboard built using Python + Streamlit to simulate and monitor appliance usage in real time — no hardware required!
